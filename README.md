# Week07 Quiz2:

## 1. Requirements:

In an advertisement for a soap manufacturer, it was decided to represent a soap drop as a bubble class. When the center coordinate and radius of a Bubble object are entered one by one in a row, it is generated by allocating dynamic memory to the Bubble object. Each time a Bubble object is created, it determines the overlap relationship with the previously created Bubble object.

- Writing code using c++
- Use `Point` class and `Bubble` class to complete your code. 
- Changing the provided class is not allowed. You can `only use the provided class and the functions defined within it`.
- You need to store the `two given class definitions` in the `Point.h` and `Bubble.h` files respectively. Store the `function definitions and the main function` in the `main.cpp` file.   
  `(Please submit the above three documents, and if you do not name the main file "main.cpp", the test will not pass and you will receive zero points)`
- Please confirm the containment relationship between classes and ensure reasonable calls between header files.

### Point class:
- Complete and use the following class:
  ```C++
  class Point {
	public:
	  Point(int x=0, int y=0, int z=0);  
	  virtual ~Point() = default;
	  int getX() const; 
	  int getY() const; 
	  int getZ() const;
	  void setX(int); 
	  void setY(int); 
	  void setZ(int);
	  virtual string toString() const;
	private:
	  int x; 
	  int y; 
	  int z;
	};

  ```
<br/>

### Bubble class
- Complete and use the following class:
  ```C++
  class Bubble : public Point {
	public:
	  Bubble(int x, int y, int z, int r=0);  
	  virtual ~Bubble() = default;
	  int getRadius() const;
	  void setRadius(int); 
	  double getVolume() const;
	  void setVolume(int);
	  virtual string toString() const;
	private:
	  int radius;
	  double volume;
	};

  ```
- Pointers to bubble objects are stored and managed in an array.
- The volume of the sphere is `4⁄3 πr^3,  with π=3.14`.
- Calculate and output volumes to less than two decimal places.
- The library function `sort is not allowed to use`.
- Bubble data is represented in the form of `center coordinates + radius`
  e.g. `(1, 1, 1) r=2`
<br/>

### Tips
The overlap relationships of bubble objects b1 and b2 are classified into four types as follows:  
```
1. b1 and b2 are disjoint.
2. b1 and b2 partially overlap
3. b1 includes b2 completely
4. b2 includes b1 completely
```  
If the same bubble generates two consecutive or overlapping relationships that are not unique, the relationship with `the smaller number among the above four relationships has priority`.  
e.g. `b1: (1, 1, 1) r=2 and b2: (1, 1, 1) r=2  ->  b1 includes b2 completely`  
<br/>
The overlap relationship of the Bubble object is determined by referring to the following figure.

### Input
- The first line contains a number (int type) representing the number of times that the compare program will apply.
- Starting from the second line, input two bubbles data in the form of `x-coordinates, y-coordinates, z-coordinates, radius`.  
  e.g. `1 1 1 2`. 

<br/>

### Output  

- Output the overlap statu of two bubbles on the first line.  
  e.g. `bubble (1, 1, 1) R=2 and bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3 partially overlap`
- Output the compare result of two bubbles on the second line.  
  e.g. `bubble with the larger volume: bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3, V=33.49`
- If the volume of two bubbles are same, output `bubble b1 and bubble b2 have the same volume, V=volume`.  
  e.g. `bubble (5, 5, 5) R=4 and bubble (3, 3, 3) R=4 have the same volume, V=267.95`

<br/>

## 2. Scoring Criteria (5 points in total):

- Uploaded `Point.h`, `Bubble.h` and `main.cpp` three files with no compilation errors: 1 point
- The cpp file calls two header files and declares the given functions: 2 point
- The result is correct: 2 point

## 3 Example(Red font for input, blue font for output):

**Input:**

```
5
1 1 1 2
3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3
7 7 7 1
7 7 7 1
5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5
5 5 5 4
5 5 5 4
3 3 3 4
```

**Output:**

```
bubble (1, 1, 1) R=2 and bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3 partially overlap
bubble with the larger volume: bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3, V=33.49
bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3 and bubble (7, 7, 7) R=1 are disjoint
bubble with the larger volume: bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3, V=113.04
bubble (7, 7, 7) R=1 is included in bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5
bubble with the larger volume: bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5, V=4.19
bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5 includes bubble (5, 5, 5) R=4
bubble with the larger volume: bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5, V=523.33
bubble (5, 5, 5) R=4 and bubble (3, 3, 3) R=4 partially overlap
bubble (5, 5, 5) R=4 and bubble (3, 3, 3) R=4 have the same volume, V=267.95
```
